# **Welcome to rad0v's project and documentation cave**

So basically whatever I learn and whatever I make is documented here. All the projects that are created by me can be found on my main github page. 

## Right now I am working on making a new portfolio website for myself, this is just a part of my old portfolio :))

## For my github go here -> https://github.com/gh0st-radov
